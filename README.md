# The Non Player Creator Graphical User Interface Edition (A.K.A. NPC GUI)

## A passion project to help one generate Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition NPCs

[The old CLI version](https://github.com/thefool309/NPCPlusPlus)

[The Python Version](https://github.com/thefool309/potential-octo-tribble/tree/main/pyfiles/NPyC)

This will be by far the most comprehensive version of NPC to date. I plan to include any various features I come up with along the way! I ask one thing, as I'm not sure if it's included in the license. Please give credit where it is due if you use this code anywhere. This is obviously not legally binding, but just a request I am making in good faith.

This particular piece of software is free, and will never prompt you to give money. However if you find yourself using it frequently and feel compelled to donate to it's development, you can contact me via Discord. Discord Username: verymuchvelma
This most likely won't be the case for anyone considering that many other character generator options are available that will be much more comprehensive and feature-rich. I won't stop you from using my passion project though!
